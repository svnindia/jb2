<p>Adobe shows off their upcoming HTML5 Animation tool, Adobe Edge. Ever since Kevin Lynch announced it at Adobe Max 2010 I've been very anxiously waiting for this prototype to mature. Edge is used to create Adobe Flash-like animations using just HTML5 web standards in a simple and promising development enviroment..<p>
