<p>Still a work in progress. But i'm really excited about finally being able to add "<b>Responsive Development</b>" to my list of skills. Suggestions/tips more than welcomed!!

<h2>Lessons learned:&nbsp;<br class="aloha-end-br"></h2>

<ul>
    <li>Not as hard as i thought.</li>

    <li>I see why it's not recommended to convert a fixed width template to a responsive one (more work)!</li>

    <li>Query strings is definitely the way to go! (no device detection scripts, or m.mysite.com)</li>
</ul>
